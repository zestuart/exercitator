## 2026-03-23 — SAST found five vulnerabilities in initial scaffold

**What happened**: First full SAST scan (Gemini 2.5 Pro) flagged 5 findings: open redirect in OAuth (Critical), global auth lockout DoS (High), unbounded request body (Medium), path traversal via date params (Medium), unbounded session storage (Medium).
**Root cause**: OAuth middleware was ported from internuntius (Python) without applying all the hardening that the original accumulated over time. Date parameters weren't validated. Session management had no limits.
**Fix**: (1) Validate redirect_uri against localhost allowlist. (2) Per-IP lockout instead of global. (3) 64 KiB body size limit on readBody(). (4) Regex date validation + encodeURIComponent on all path-interpolated params. (5) Max 100 sessions + 5-minute idle timeout with periodic pruning.
**Prevention**: SAST scan is mandatory before every deploy. Added date regex validation pattern as standard for all date-accepting tools.

## 2026-03-23 — Claude Desktop connector fails with path mismatches

**What happened**: After deploying to Arca Ingens, Claude Desktop could not connect as a connector. Same issues previously hit in the signifer project.
**Root cause**: Two Claude Desktop behaviours differ from the OAuth/MCP specs: (1) It POSTs to `/` after OAuth completes, not `/mcp` where StreamableHTTPServerTransport listens. (2) It constructs OAuth endpoints as `/authorize`, `/token`, `/register` by appending to the server URL, rather than reading the full paths from RFC 8414 metadata (`/oauth/authorize`, etc.).
**Fix**: (1) Match both `/` and `/mcp` in the MCP request handler. (2) Match both `/oauth/authorize` and `/authorize` (and same for `/token`, `/register`) in the OAuth middleware.
**Prevention**: When implementing MCP OAuth for Claude Desktop connectors, always accept both short and prefixed OAuth paths, and handle `/` as an alias for `/mcp`.

## 2026-03-23 — OAuth token exchange failed: three compounding bugs

**What happened**: Claude Desktop connector completed passphrase entry but failed with "Authorization with the MCP server failed". Three separate issues:
**Root cause**: (1) PKCE verification used `createHmac("sha256", emptyKey)` instead of `createHash("sha256")` — HMAC with empty key produces different output than SHA-256, so every PKCE challenge comparison failed. (2) Registration response included `client_secret` and set `token_endpoint_auth_method: "client_secret_post"` — Claude Desktop expects `"none"` for browser-based auth_code flow. (3) Allowed redirect URIs only included localhost — Claude Desktop uses `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback`.
**Fix**: (1) Switch to `createHash("sha256")` for PKCE. (2) Registration returns `token_endpoint_auth_method: "none"`, no client_secret. (3) Added `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` to allowed redirect URIs.
**Prevention**: Always test OAuth with an actual Claude Desktop connector before declaring it working. PKCE S256 is SHA-256, not HMAC-SHA-256.

## 2026-03-23 — intervals.icu rejects YYYY-MM-DD dates for event creation

**What happened**: `create_event` tool returned 422 Unprocessable Entity when passing a date-only string.
**Root cause**: intervals.icu expects a datetime string (`2026-03-24T00:00:00`), not a date-only string (`2026-03-24`).
**Fix**: Append `T00:00:00` to date-only strings in the `create_event` handler before forwarding to the API.
**Prevention**: When interfacing with external APIs, verify the exact format they expect — don't assume ISO 8601 date-only is sufficient even when the parameter is called "date".

## 2026-03-23 — Stale connector state after container rebuild

**What happened**: After deploying a fix and rebuilding the container, Claude Desktop reported every tool returning generic errors — despite the server being healthy and responding to curl.
**Root cause**: Container rebuild invalidated all existing MCP sessions. Claude Desktop cached the previous auth/session state and kept reusing it rather than re-authenticating.
**Fix**: Remove the connector in Claude Desktop Settings → Connectors, then re-add it.
**Prevention**: After any container rebuild that changes the server process, warn users to remove and re-add the connector. This is a Claude Desktop limitation — stale auth state is not automatically cleared on server restart.

## 2026-03-24 — Stale mcp-session-id causes "Server not initialized" after container restart

**What happened**: After container rebuild, the Claude.ai connector kept sending `mcp-session-id` from the previous container. The server's original code created a new `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` for the unknown session and handed it a non-initialize request (`tools/call`). The MCP SDK rejected this with "Bad Request: Server not initialized" because the transport had never received an `initialize` message.
**Root cause**: The session lookup fell through to the "new session" code path, which created a fresh transport. But a fresh transport expects `initialize` as its first message, not `tools/call`. The connector doesn't drop its cached session ID on error.
**Fix**: Added explicit handling for stale session IDs — return HTTP 404 with a JSON-RPC error body before reaching the new-session code path. This is spec-correct per the MCP streamable-http transport specification. The Claude.ai connector does not currently auto-recover from 404 (requires manual reconnection), but the error is now clear instead of cryptic.
**Prevention**: Always check for stale session IDs between the "existing session" lookup and the "new session" creation. Never create a new transport for a request that carries a session ID not in the session map.
