## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project setup via Armature framework
- TypeScript MCP server with dual transport (stdio / streamable-http)
- intervals.icu API client with Basic auth
- MCP tools: athlete profile, activities, wellness, calendar events
- OAuth middleware with PKCE, passphrase gate, signed tokens, rate limiting
- SQLite cache layer for infrequently-changing data
- Docker + Docker Compose with Tailscale funnel sidecar
- Biome linting/formatting, TypeScript strict mode, Vitest test suite
- Per-session McpServer instantiation for streamable-http (max 100, 5-min idle timeout)

### Fixed
- Streamable-http crash on second request — McpServer.connect() called once per session, not per request

### Security
- Fixed open redirect in OAuth authorisation flow — redirect_uri validated against localhost allowlist
- Fixed global authentication lockout DoS — lockout tracking is now per-IP
- Added 64 KiB request body size limit on OAuth endpoints
- Added YYYY-MM-DD regex validation on all date parameters to prevent path traversal
- Added URL encoding (encodeURIComponent) on path-interpolated parameters
- Added session cap (100) and idle timeout (5 min) to prevent memory exhaustion
